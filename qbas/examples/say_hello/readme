	This is a complete Qt example on how to use the QBAS environment
to build your projects.

	To compile it just try with "./configure && make". Pay attention
to have Qt installed correctly ( see the main "readme" at section
"usage" ). The program only set a window to say hello, but checks for many 
controls and gives you an example of the QBAS power!

	The example code is licensed free.
